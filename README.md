Choose a list size to play with. A random list of integers between 1 and 10 will be generated to fill the list.

After the list is created call heads or tails on a coin toss to determine who goes first.
If you lose the computer will decide.

The player and computer then alternate taking turns picking either the first number or the last number in the list
to add to their scores. The highest score at the end of the game wins!
